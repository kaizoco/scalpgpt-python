# Examples have moved to the [ScalpGPT Cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/)

Looking for code examples? Visit the [ScalpGPT Cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/), which shares examples of how to use the ScalpGPT Python library to accomplish common tasks.

Prior to July 2022, code examples were hosted in this examples folder; going forward, code examples will be hosted in the [ScalpGPT Cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/).

This separation will help keep the [ScalpGPT Python library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) simple and small, without extra files or dependencies.
